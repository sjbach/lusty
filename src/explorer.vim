" Release Date: February 24, 2012
"      Version: 4.3
"
"        Usage:
"                 <Leader>lf  - Opens the filesystem explorer.
"                 <Leader>lr  - Opens the filesystem explorer from the
"                               directory of the current file.
"                 <Leader>lb  - Opens the buffer explorer.
"                 <Leader>lg  - Opens the buffer grep, for searching through
"                               all loaded buffers
"
"               You can also use the commands:
"
"                 ":LustyFilesystemExplorer [optional-path]"
"                 ":LustyFilesystemExplorerFromHere"
"                 ":LustyBufferExplorer"
"                 ":LustyBufferGrep"
"
"               To suppress the default mappings, set this option:
"
"                 let g:LustyExplorerDefaultMappings = 0
"
"               When launched, a new window appears at bottom presenting a
"               table of files/dirs or buffers, and in the status bar a
"               prompt:
"
"                 >>
"
"               As you type, the table updates for possible matches using a
"               fuzzy matching algorithm (or regex matching, in the case of
"               grep).  Special keys include:
"
"                 <Enter>  open selected match
"                 <Tab>    open selected match
"                 <Esc>    cancel
"                 <C-c>    cancel
"                 <C-g>    cancel
"
"                 <C-t>    open selected match in a new [t]ab
"                 <C-o>    open selected match in a new h[o]rizontal split
"                 <C-v>    open selected match in a new [v]ertical split
"
"                 <C-n>    select [n]ext match
"                 <C-p>    select [p]revious match
"                 <C-f>    select [f]orward one column
"                 <C-b>    select [b]ack one column
"
"                 <C-u>    clear prompt
"
"               Additional shortcuts for the filesystem explorer:
"
"                 <C-w>    ascend one directory at prompt
"                 <C-r>    [r]efresh directory contents
"                 <C-a>    open [a]ll files in current table
"                 <C-e>    create new buffer with the given name and path
"
" Filesystem Explorer:
"
"  - Directory contents are memoized.  (<C-r> to refresh.)
"  - You can recurse into and out of directories by typing the directory name
"    and a slash, e.g. "stuff/" or "../".
"  - Variable expansion, e.g. "$D" -> "/long/dir/path/".
"  - Tilde (~) expansion, e.g. "~/" -> "/home/steve/".
"  - Dotfiles are hidden by default, but are shown if the current search term
"    begins with a '.'.  To show these file at all times, set this option:
"
"       let g:LustyExplorerAlwaysShowDotFiles = 1
"
"  You can prevent certain files from appearing in the table with the
"  following variable:
"
"    set wildignore=*.o,*.fasl,CVS
"
"  The above will mask all object files, compiled lisp files, and
"  files/directories named CVS from appearing in the table.  Note that they
"  can still be opened by being named explicitly.
"
"  See :help 'wildignore' for more information.
"
" Buffer Explorer:
"
"  - Buffers are sorted first by fuzzy match and then by most-recently used.
"  - The currently active buffer is highlighted.
"
" Buffer Grep:
"
"  - Searches all loaded buffers.
"  - Uses Ruby-style regexes instead of Vim style.  This means:
"
"    - \b instead of \< or \> for beginning/end of word.
"    - (foo|bar) instead of \(foo\|bar\)
"    - {2,5} instead of \{2,5}
"    - + instead of \+
"    - Generally, fewer backslashes. :-)
"
"  - For now, searches are always case-insensitive.
"  - Matches from the previous grep are remembered upon relaunch;  clear with
"    <C-u>.
"
"
" Install Details:
"
" Copy this file into $HOME/.vim/plugin directory so that it will be sourced
" on startup automatically.
"
" Note! This plugin requires Vim be compiled with Ruby interpretation.  If you
" don't know if your build of Vim has this functionality, you can check by
" running "vim --version" from the command line and looking for "+ruby".
" Alternatively, just try sourcing this script.
"
" If your version of Vim does not have "+ruby" but you would still like to
" use this plugin, you can fix it.  See the "Check for Ruby functionality"
" comment below for instructions.
"
" If you are using the same Vim configuration and plugins for multiple
" machines, some of which have Ruby and some of which don't, you may want to
" turn off the "Sorry, LustyExplorer requires ruby" warning.  You can do so
" like this (in .vimrc):
"
"   let g:LustyExplorerSuppressRubyWarning = 1
"

" Patches and suggestions welcome.  Note: lusty-explorer.vim is a generated

" TODO:
" - when an edited file is in nowrap mode and the explorer is called while the
"   current window is scrolled to the right, name truncation occurs.
" - enable VimSwaps stuff
"   - set callback when pipe is ready for read and force refresh()
" - uppercase character should make matching case-sensitive
" - FilesystemGrep
" - C-jhkl navigation to highlight a file?

" Exit quickly when already loaded.
