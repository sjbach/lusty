" Release Date: February 29, 2012
"      Version: 1.5.1
"
"        Usage:
"                 <Leader>lj  - Opens the buffer juggler.
"
"               You can also use this command:
"
"                 ":LustyJuggler"
"
"               To suppress the default mapping, set this option:
"
"                 let g:LustyJugglerDefaultMappings = 0
"
"               When launched, the command bar at bottom is replaced with a
"               new bar showing the names of currently-opened buffers in
"               most-recently-used order.
"
"               By default, LustyJuggler follows the QWERTY layout, and
"               buffers are mapped to these keys:
"
"                   1st|2nd|3rd|4th|5th|6th|7th|8th|9th|10th
"                   ----------------------------------------
"                   a   s   d   f   g   h   j   k   l   ;
"                   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0
"
"               So if you type "f" or "4", the fourth buffer name will be
"               highlighted and the bar will shift to center it as necessary
"               (and show more of the buffer names on the right).
"
"               If you want to switch to that buffer, press "f" or "4" again
"               or press "<ENTER>".  Alternatively, press one of the other
"               mapped keys to highlight another buffer.  To open the buffer
"               in a new split, press "b" for horizontal or "v" for vertical.
"
"               To display the key with the name of the buffer, add one of
"               the following lines to your .vimrc:
"
"                 let g:LustyJugglerShowKeys = 'a'   (for alpha characters)
"                 let g:LustyJugglerShowKeys = 1     (for digits)
"
"               To cancel the juggler, press any of "q", "<ESC>", "<C-c",
"               "<BS>", "<Del>", or "<C-h>".
"
"               LustyJuggler also supports the Dvorak, Colemak, Bépo and aerty
"               keyboard layouts. To enable this feature, place the one of the
"               following in your .vimrc:
"
"                 let g:LustyJugglerKeyboardLayout = "dvorak"
"                 let g:LustyJugglerKeyboardLayout = "colemak"
"                 let g:LustyJugglerKeyboardLayout = "bépo"
"                 let g:LustyJugglerKeyboardLayout = "azerty"
"
"               With the layout set to "dvorak", the buffer mapping is as
"               follows:
"
"                   1st|2nd|3rd|4th|5th|6th|7th|8th|9th|10th
"                   ----------------------------------------
"                   a   o   e   u   i   d   h   t   n   s
"                   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0
"
"               With the layout set to "colemak", the buffer mapping is as
"               follows:
"
"                   1st|2nd|3rd|4th|5th|6th|7th|8th|9th|10th
"                   ----------------------------------------
"                   a   r   s   t   d   h   n   e   i   o
"                   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0
"
"               With the layout set to "bépo", the buffer mapping is as
"               follows:
"
"                   1st|2nd|3rd|4th|5th|6th|7th|8th|9th|10th
"                   ----------------------------------------
"                   a   u   i   e   ,   t   s   r   n   m
"                   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0
"
"               With the layout set to "azerty", the buffer mapping is as
"               follows:
"
"                   1st|2nd|3rd|4th|5th|6th|7th|8th|9th|10th
"                   ----------------------------------------

"
"               LustyJuggler can act very much like <A-Tab> window switching.
"               To enable this mode, add the following line to your .vimrc:
"
"                 let g:LustyJugglerAltTabMode = 1
"
"               Then, given the following mapping:
"
"                 noremap <silent> <A-s> :LustyJuggler<CR>
"
"               Pressing "<A-s>" will launch the LustyJuggler with the
"               previous buffer highlighted. Typing "<A-s>" again will cycle
"               to the next buffer (in most-recently used order), and
"               "<ENTER>" will open the highlighted buffer.  For example, the
"               sequence "<A-s><Enter>" will open the previous buffer, and
"               "<A-s><A-s><Enter>" will open the buffer used just before the
"               previous buffer, and so on.
"
"        Bonus: This plugin also includes the following command, which will
"               immediately switch to your previously used buffer:
"
"                 ":LustyJugglePrevious"
"
"               This is similar to the ":b#" command, but accounts for the
"               common situation where the previously used buffer (#) has
"               been killed and is thus inaccessible.  In that case, it will
"               instead switch to the buffer used before that one (and on down
"               the line if that buffer has been killed too).
"
"
" Install Details:
"
" Copy this file into $HOME/.vim/plugin directory so that it will be sourced
" on startup automatically.
"
" Note! This plugin requires Vim be compiled with Ruby interpretation.  If you
" don't know if your build of Vim has this functionality, you can check by
" running "vim --version" from the command line and looking for "+ruby".
" Alternatively, just try sourcing this script.
"
" If your version of Vim does not have "+ruby" but you would still like to
" use this plugin, you can fix it.  See the "Check for Ruby functionality"
" comment below for instructions.
"
" If you are using the same Vim configuration and plugins for multiple
" machines, some of which have Ruby and some of which don't, you may want to
" turn off the "Sorry, LustyJuggler requires ruby" warning.  You can do so
" like this (in .vimrc):
"
"   let g:LustyJugglerSuppressRubyWarning = 1
